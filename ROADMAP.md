# üó∫Ô∏è CANTON AGENT TOKENIZATION - FEATURE ROADMAP

**Document Version**: 1.0
**Created**: 2025-10-03
**Last Updated**: 2025-10-03
**Status**: Planning Phase

---

## üéØ **NEXT MAJOR FEATURE: Agent Transaction Identity**

### **FEATURE OVERVIEW**

**Goal**: Enable AI agents to own their own DAML party IDs and execute blockchain transactions autonomously, with configurable spending limits and owner oversight.

**Current State**: Agents have registration records and ownership/usage tokens, but cannot transact independently on the blockchain.

**Target State**: Agents have their own party IDs, can hold assets, execute transactions, and interact with other agents/parties while maintaining security controls.

---

## üìã **FEATURE SPECIFICATION**

### **Core Concept**
Each registered agent gets its own DAML party ID that can:
- Hold digital assets (tokens, NFTs, etc.)
- Execute transactions within defined limits
- Interact with other agents and parties
- Maintain transaction history and reputation

### **Enhanced AgentRegistration Contract**

**Current AgentRegistration Fields:**
```daml
template AgentRegistration
  with
    agentId : Text
    agentName : Text
    description : Text
    capabilities : [Text]
    owner : Party
    createdAt : Time
```

**Proposed Enhanced AgentRegistration:**
```daml
template AgentRegistration
  with
    agentId : Text
    agentName : Text
    description : Text
    capabilities : [Text]
    owner : Party
    createdAt : Time

    -- NEW AGENT TRANSACTION IDENTITY FIELDS
    agentParty : Party              -- Agent's own party ID for transactions
    maxSpendingLimit : Decimal      -- Maximum amount agent can spend autonomously (per period)
    spendingPeriod : RelTime        -- Time period for spending limit (e.g., daily/weekly)
    approvalRequired : Bool         -- Owner approval required for transactions above limit
    autonomyLevel : AutonomyLevel   -- SUPERVISED | LIMITED | AUTONOMOUS
    allowedCounterparties : [Party] -- Whitelist of parties agent can transact with
    emergencyStop : Bool            -- Owner can freeze agent transactions
    lastTransactionTime : Time      -- Track agent activity
    totalSpentThisPeriod : Decimal  -- Running total for spending limit enforcement
```

### **New Data Types Required**
```daml
data AutonomyLevel = SUPERVISED | LIMITED | AUTONOMOUS
  deriving (Eq, Show)

-- SUPERVISED: All transactions require owner approval
-- LIMITED: Transactions within limits are autonomous, above limits require approval
-- AUTONOMOUS: Agent can transact freely within all defined constraints
```

## üìù **IMPLEMENTATION NOTES FOR NEXT SESSION**

### **Where to Start**
1. **Begin with Phase 1.1**: Enhance the `AgentRegistration` contract in `daml/AgentTokenizationV2.daml`
2. **Test with existing data**: Ensure current agents can be upgraded to new schema
3. **Update registration script**: Modify `demoV2System` to create agent parties

### **Key Files to Modify**
- `daml/AgentTokenizationV2.daml` - Add new fields to AgentRegistration
- `generate-long-jwt-tokens.js` - Include agent party IDs in JWT tokens
- `DAML scripts` - Update agent creation to allocate party IDs
- `README_ANSWERS.md` - Update API documentation with new capabilities

### **Testing Strategy**
- Start with one test agent with transaction capabilities
- Verify spending limits work correctly
- Test owner approval workflow
- Validate emergency stop functionality
- Confirm existing system compatibility

### **Integration Considerations**
- Current 7-wallet system provides perfect testing environment
- Agent parties should integrate with existing ngrok tunnel setup
- PostgreSQL schema should handle new fields automatically
- JSON API endpoints remain backward compatible

---

## üéØ **EXPECTED OUTCOMES**

### **After Full Implementation**
